# Seaweed Spectral Library

This repository contains information about creating a spectral library of different seaweeds.

Measurements were all made in the lab, with samples collected from different locations along Maine's coast.

The reflectance for each sample are in the **`spectral_library.csv`** file.

## File Descriptions

**`01-Creating-sample_list_v2`** is the workflow to include the time stamps and number of measurements for each sample in the `sample_list` csv file
**`02-SpectralLibraryCreation`** is the workflow to create `spectral_library.csv` from the raw .sed files
**`Measurement Setup.md`** contains information on the measurements for each sample (both experimental design and measurement approach)
**`sample_list_v1.csv`** is the sample information copied from the lab notebook (from the experiment days)
**`sample_list_v2.csv`** is as v1, plus the time stamp for each sample and the number of measurements taken for each sample
**`spectral_library.csv`** the mean reflectance and standard deviation for each sample
