# Seaweed Spectral Library

This repository contains information about creating a spectral library of different seaweeds.

Measurements were all made in the lab, with samples collected from different locations along Maine's coast.

## File Descriptions

**`01-Creating-sample_list_v2`** is the workflow to include the time stamps and number of measurements for each sample in the `sample_list` csv file for TNC Basin and the first Pemaquid visit

**`01a-Creating-sample_list_v3`** is the workflow to include the time stamps and number of measurements for each sample in the `sample_list` csv file for TNC Basin and both Pemaquid visits

**`02-SpectralLibraryCreation`** is the workflow to create `spectral_library.csv` from the raw .sed files for TNC Basin and the first Pemaquid visit

**`02a-SpectralLibraryCreation_v2`** is the workflow to create `spectral_library.csv` from the raw .sed files for TNC Basin and both Pemaquid visits

**`03` and `04`** notebooks visualize the spectral library data and the leaf clip data respectively

**`05` and `06`** notebooks perform partial least squares regression to model the relationship between biomass and reflectance for asco and fucus respectively

**`Measurement Setup.md`** contains information on the measurements for each sample (both experimental design and measurement approach)

**`sample_list_v1.csv`** is the sample information copied from the lab notebook (from the experiment days)  for TNC Basin and the first Pemaquid visit

**`sample_list_v2.csv`** is as v1, plus the time stamp for each sample and the number of measurements taken for each sample

**`sample_list_v3.csv`** is as v2, plus the second Pemaquid visit data

**`spectral_library.csv`** the mean reflectance and standard deviation for each sample for TNC Basin and the first Pemaquid visit

**`spectral_library_v2.csv`** is as v1, plus the second Pemaquid visit data
